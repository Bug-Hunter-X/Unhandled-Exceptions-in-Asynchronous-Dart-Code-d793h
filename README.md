# Unhandled Exceptions in Asynchronous Dart Code

This repository demonstrates a common issue in Dart:  insufficient exception handling in asynchronous operations. The provided `bug.dart` file shows code that fails to handle exceptions comprehensively, leading to potential issues in production environments.  The `bugSolution.dart` file provides an improved version with better error handling and logging.

## Problem

The original code uses a generic `catch` block without specifying the exception type.  This makes it difficult to identify and address the root cause of errors, potentially leading to unexpected application behavior or crashes.  Furthermore, the lack of specific error handling obscures the nature of the problem.

## Solution

The improved code utilizes more specific `catch` blocks to handle different exception types. This allows for more targeted error handling and better debugging capabilities.  Additionally, it includes enhanced logging to provide more context when an error occurs.
